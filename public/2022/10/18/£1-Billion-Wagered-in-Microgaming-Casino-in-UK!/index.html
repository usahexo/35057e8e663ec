<h1 id="£10-000-000-Wagered-in-a-Single-Day-at-Microgaming-Casino"><a href="#£10-000-000-Wagered-in-a-Single-Day-at-Microgaming-Casino" class="headerlink" title="£10,000,000 Wagered in a Single Day at Microgaming Casino"></a>£10,000,000 Wagered in a Single Day at Microgaming Casino</h1><p>Microgaming, a leading software provider for online casinos, has set a new record for the largest amount wagered in a single day. On October 2, 2016, players at Microgaming-powered casinos gambled a total of €10,711,000 (approximately £10,000,000).</p>
<p>This milestone was reached thanks to the launch of two new games: “Battlestar Galactica” and “Thunderstruck II”. The former is a five-reel slot based on the popular sci-fi series, while the latter is a Norse mythology-themed sequel to one of Microgaming’s most popular slots. Both games proved to be instant hits with players.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Andrew Clucas, Head of Slots at Microgaming, said: “To break our own record for the highest amount wagered in a single day is an incredible achievement and testament to the popularity of our new games. We’re thrilled that so many players have enjoyed playing Battlestar Galactica and Thunderstruck II and we can’t wait to see what new records we can break in the future.”</p>

According to statistics, in 2017, it was worth an estimated £43.5 billion (US$56.2 billion), and is expected to grow at a rate of 6% per year. Much of this revenue is generated by casinos, which offer a wide range of games – including slots, table games, and sports betting – to their customers.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise, then, that gambling companies are eager to invest in new technologies and platforms that can help them stay ahead of the competition. In recent years, this has seen them turn to blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>As well as providing a secure and transparent platform for online transactions, blockchain technology also allows for the development of decentralised casino platforms. These platforms offer a number of advantages over traditional casinos, including greater transparency and security, improved fairness and provability of games, and lower costs for players.</p>
<p>One such platform is CasinoCoin (CSC), which is built on the Bitcoin Cash network and uses smart contracts to provide a secure and transparent gaming experience. CSC has already attracted a number of high-profile partners, including leading online casino operator BitCasino.io.</p>
<p>BitCasino.io is one of the largest online casinos in the world, with over 1,500 casino games on offer. It has been operating since 2014 and has over 2 million registered users. The team behind BitCasino.io is dedicated to offering its players the best possible gaming experience, which includes using the latest technologies and innovations. This commitment led them to partner with CasinoCoin in early 2018.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the partnership agreement, BitCasino.io will use CSC as its exclusive currency for all transactions on the site. This will include both deposits and withdrawals for players, as well as payments for game providers and other service providers within the casino ecosystem.</p>
<p>In addition, BitCasino will help promote CasinoCoin through its extensive marketing channels, including social media networks and affiliate programs. It will also work with CasinoCoin to develop new games specifically for use on the platform.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership agreement, BitCasino CEO Ivan Montik said: “We are very excited about this partnership as CasinoCoin represents everything that we believe in – innovation , security ,and most importantly player focus . We look forward to working together with them to bring even more exciting products to our players”</p>
