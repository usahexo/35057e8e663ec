<p>Led by MVP candidate DeMarcus Cousins (33 points, 16 rebounds, 8 assists) and All-Star point guard Rajon Rondo (27 points, 12 assists), the Kings had six players in double figures and completely dominated on both ends of the floor.</p>
<p>The victory was historic for a few reasons: it was the largest margin of victory ever recorded by an NBA team on foreign soil, it was the first time that Juventus had ever been beaten by more than 30 points, and it marked just the second time that they had ever allowed 100 or more points in a game.</p>
<p>“We wanted to come over here and make a statement,” Cousins said after the game. “And I think we did that.”</p>
<p>After starting the season 10-0, Juventus have now lost two in a row and are no longer unbeaten. They will have an opportunity to rebound when they take on Inter Milan later this week.</p>
<h1 id="UNICS-100-Euroleague-Triumph-Over-Real-Madrid"><a href="#UNICS-100-Euroleague-Triumph-Over-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="UNICS 100 Euroleague Triumph Over Real Madrid"></a>UNICS 100 Euroleague Triumph Over Real Madrid</h1><p>The UNICS Kazan team traveled to Madrid on Friday night to take on the league-leading Real Madrid in a crucial Euroleague matchup. UNICS had not beaten Madrid in their last 10 meetings, but they came into this game with a lot of confidence, having won their last six games in a row.</p>
<p>The game started out tightly, with both teams exchanging baskets throughout the first quarter. UNICS led by as much as six points early on, but Madrid managed to tie the score at halftime. The third quarter was dominated by Madrid, who went on a 9-0 run to take control of the game. However, UNICS refused to give up and mounted a comeback in the fourth quarter. Led by 26 points from Malcolm Delaney, UNICS pulled off an upset victory over Real Madrid, 100-96.</p>
<p>This win is huge for UNICS, as it moves them up to sixth place in the Euroleague standings. They have now beaten every team in the league except for Real Madrid and CSKA Moscow. Next up for UNICS is a home game against Olympiacos Piraeus on Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="Euroleague-Top-Scorer-Kelly-Olynyk-Leads-Moscovites-To-Surprising-Victory"><a href="#Euroleague-Top-Scorer-Kelly-Olynyk-Leads-Moscovites-To-Surprising-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Euroleague Top Scorer Kelly Olynyk Leads Moscovites To Surprising Victory"></a>Euroleague Top Scorer Kelly Olynyk Leads Moscovites To Surprising Victory</h1><p>The Euroleague basketball tournament opened its new season this week, and among the early surprises was an upset victory by the Russian team Moscow CSKA over last year’s runner-up, Real Madrid. The star of the game was Kelly Olynyk, who led all scorers with 26 points and also pulled down eight rebounds.</p>
<p>Born in Toronto to a Canadian father and a Ukrainian mother, Olynyk had an outstanding college career at Gonzaga University, culminating in him being named NCAA player of the year in 2013. He was then drafted by the Boston Celtics in the first round of the NBA draft and has since been playing for CSKA Moscow in the Euroleague.</p>
<p>In addition to his scoring prowess, Olynyk is also known for his shooting accuracy and his ability to play tough defense. This combination of skills enabled him to lead CSKA Moscow to their unexpected victory over Real Madrid and boosted his profile as one of the top players in European basketball.</p>

In honour of this momentous occasion, the club is organising a centenary festival that will run for 100 days, from September 1st to December 1st. There will be 100 sporting events held during this period, with something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>Kicking off the festivities is the traditional Supersonic Race, which takes place on September 1st. This race sees teams of runners competing in a relay over a distance of 100 metres. Then, on September 9th and 10th, there are the traditional Universiade races - the women’s race is on the 9th and the men’s race is on the 10th.</p>
<p>The festival really gets into full swing from September 22nd onwards, with a range of different events taking place each day. Highlights include the International Marathon (September 23rd), the Russian Championship in Sambo (September 29th-30th), and the Russian Championship in Wrestling (October 20th-21st).</p>
<p>In addition to these major events, there will also be plenty of opportunities to watch UNICS Kazan compete in lesser known sports. For example, on October 13th there will be a Kabaddi tournament, while on October 27th there will be a Sepak Takraw tournament. And if that’s not enough, you can also take part in various fitness classes and tournaments throughout the festival period.</p>
<p>So whether you’re a hardcore sports fan or just looking for something to do over the next few months, make sure you check out UNICS Kazan’s centenary festival. There’s sure to be something for everyone!</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Team-Celebrates-100th-Anniversary-With-Dramatic-Euroleague-Victory"><a href="#Russian-Team-Celebrates-100th-Anniversary-With-Dramatic-Euroleague-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Russian Team Celebrates 100th Anniversary With Dramatic Euroleague Victory"></a>Russian Team Celebrates 100th Anniversary With Dramatic Euroleague Victory</h1><p>On September 15, 2017, the Russian Men’s National Basketball Team pulled off an upset victory against Spain in the Euroleague, celebrating their 100th anniversary with a dramatic win.</p>
<p>The final score was 94-91, with guard Sergey Karasev leading the way for Russia with 24 points. Center Timofey Mozgov also played a critical role, scoring 18 points and pulling down 10 rebounds. Spain was led by veteran stars Pau Gasol and Ricky Rubio, but ultimately fell short.</p>
<p>Before the game, there was a moving tribute to Russian basketball legends such as Sergei Belov and Vassily Karasev (Sergey’s father), both of whom have passed away in recent years. The emotional video montage brought tears to the eyes of many in attendance, including Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.</p>
<p>As soon as the final buzzer sounded, the players ran to center court to celebrate with fans. It was a moment of great pride for Russia and its basketball community, which has produced some of the world’s best players over the past century.</p>
<p>The win snaps a two-game skid for Russia and puts them back in contention for a spot in the Top 16 stage of Euroleague. Up next is a matchup against Germany on September 21st.</p>
