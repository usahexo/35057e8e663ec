The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a jack, queen or king (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.</p>
<p>The player who first reaches 101 or more points, wins the game. If both players reach 101 points at the same time, the player with the higher-valued card (K&#x3D;10, Q&#x3D;9, J&#x3D;8) is the winner.</p>
<p>To start a round of bons, each player is dealt six cards. The player with the highest-valued card begins the round and play passes clockwise from there. On a player’s turn, they must either play one card from their hand or draw one from the deck. When playing a card, it must be lower in rank than the previously played card. For example, if an ace has been played then only a 2 or lower can be played next. If a player cannot play any cards from their hand then they must draw one from the deck.</p>
<p>When all cards have been played, or when both players have no cards left to play, the final card point total is calculated. The face value of all remaining cards are added together to create the score for that turn - for example 2+5+3&#x3D;10 points. The winner of that particular turn then takes another turn and play continues until one player either reaches 101 or more points and wins the game; or when both players reach 101 and neither has a higher-valued card so they must compare their two lowest-valued cards to decide who wins; or when someone runs out of cards and loses automatically (in which case that player’s opponent automatically wins).</p>
<p>Now that we know how to play casino card game bons lets take a look at some strategy tips!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Casino-Card-Game-Bons"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Casino-Card-Game-Bons" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Casino Card Game Bons"></a>How to Win at Casino Card Game Bons</h1><p>There are a few things you can do in order to give yourself the best chance of winning casino card game bons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of what cards have been played: This will help you work out what cards your opponent may still have in their hand and what cards are likely available for you to play next. You can do this by simply marking off each card as it is played on a piece of paper (or in your head).</li>
<li>Try not to get stuck: If you find yourself with no playable cards then don’t be afraid to draw new ones from the deck - just make sure you can actually play them if it gets back to you!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Casino-Card-Game-Bons"><a href="#How-to-Play-Casino-Card-Game-Bons" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Casino Card Game Bons"></a>How to Play Casino Card Game Bons</h1><p>Bons is a casino card game that is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to score points by taking as many tricks as possible. There are different versions of the game, but the most common version is played by two players.</p>
<p>The Deal</p>
<p>The deal is commenced by dealing six cards each, face down. The player who holds the lowest rank card begins the bidding process and must either bid “one”, which means they will take one trick; “two”, which means they will take two tricks; or “three”, which means they will take three tricks. If a player cannot bid, they must pass. The player who wins the bidding then takes all six of their cards and sets them face up in front of them in three piles of two cards each (similar to Solitaire). The remainder of the deck is placed face down in the middle of the players, and this becomes the playing stack.</p>
<p>The Play</p>
<p>The player to the left of the dealer starts the play by flipping over the top card of their playing stack. This card becomes their lead card and they must place it face up on one of their three piles (they cannot put it back into their hand). If they cannot put the lead card onto any of their piles, then they must pick up another card from their playing stack and add it to their hand (face down). The other player then does the same, flipping over the top card from their playing stack and placing it onto one of their piles (if possible), or picking up another card if not. When both players have no more cards in their playing stacks, then they each pick up all six cards from their face-up piles and set them back into three new face-down piles - one for each suit (clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds). The turn now passes to the left and play continues like this until all 52 cards have been played.</p>
<p>The winner is determined by counting how many tricks have been won - so if Player 1 has won 10 tricks and Player 2 has won 8 tricks, then Player 1 would be declared as the winner.</p>

The object of the game is to score points by taking cards that total 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. In order to increase your chances of winning, here are some tips and tricks that you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When choosing a card to take, try to find one that will give you the best chance of getting close to 21 without going over. For example, if you have an Ace and a 4, taking another Ace would give you a score of 21 while taking another 4 would give you a score of 18.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have a choice between two cards, always choose the one that is less likely to cause you to go over 21. For example, if you have an Ace and a 2, taking another Ace would give you a score of 21 while taking another 2 would give you a score of 20.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use your chips to control how much risk you are taking. If you are close to going over 21, put down some chips so that you cannot take any more cards. This will limit your losses if you do go over 21.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take into account the point values of the different cards. The higher point value cards are worth more than the lower point value cards. For example, an Ace is worth 1 point, a 2 is worth 2 points, etc.</p>
</li>

<li>How do I play casino Bons?</li>
</ol>
<p>To play casino Bons, you will need to be familiar with basic card games such as Hearts, Spades, and Euchre.

The rank of cards in descending order are as follows: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. A player must follow suit if they are able to do so; otherwise they can play any other card in their hand. The winner of each trick leads to the next one.</p>
