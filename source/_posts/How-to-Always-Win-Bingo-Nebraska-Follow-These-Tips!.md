This simply means betting on as many numbers as possible in order to cover as many squares on your card as possible. Of course, there are countless other strategies out there; feel free to experiment until you find one that works best for you.

Tip #4: Don’t Get Discouraged

Even the best players lose sometimes; it’s all part of the game. If you happen to lose your money, don’t get discouraged – simply learn from your mistakes and come back stronger next time. Remember, the goal is to have fun, so don’t take things too seriously!
