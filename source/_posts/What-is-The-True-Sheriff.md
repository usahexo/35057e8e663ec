You will then be taken to a screen with five reels. Each reel has nine symbols – three in each row. The symbols include sheriff badges, pistols, stetsons, horseshoes, and cash bags. The aim of the game is to match three or more symbols on a payline to win prizes. Prizes are awarded for matching two different symbols and increased for matching three or more symbols.

In addition to the regular symbols, there are two special symbols – the sheriff badge and the outlaw. The sheriff badge is wild and can substitute for any other symbol except for the outlaw. The outlaw is a scatter symbol and pays out prizes when two or more are matched.

When you first start playing The True Sheriff, your goal is to complete the mission assigned to you. This involves collecting ten cash bags hidden around town. Once you have collected ten cash bags, you will automatically move on to the next level, where new challenges await you.
