The first step is to find the right weapon for the job. Weapons with high fire rate and damage work best against Walker. The flamethrower is a good option, as it has both high fire rate and damage. Other weapons that can be used include the assault rifle, shotgun, and rocket launcher.

The next step is to find the right spot to fight Walker. It is best to fight him in an open area where there are few obstacles. This will allow players to move around more easily and avoid Walker's attacks.

#  10 Tips for Beating Endwalker in Expert Different Roulette Games

Expert roulette games are different. The rules are more complex, and the odds are higher. That doesn’t mean they’re unbeatable, but it does mean you need to be smarter about how you play.

The following ten tips are designed to help you win against endwalkers in expert roulette games:

1. Use Systems

There’s no one perfect system for beating endwalkers in expert roulette games, but there are a few systems that can give you a better chance of winning. Roulette systems can be complicated, but they basically involve betting on certain combinations of numbers in order to increase your chances of winning.

2. Bet on Corners

Betting on corners is a good way to reduce the odds of the endwalker winning. When you bet on a corner, you’re betting on four numbers instead of one, which means the chances of your number coming up are higher.

3. Avoid Straight Bets

Straight bets are very risky and offer poor odds compared to other types of bets. If you want to beat an endwalker, it’s best to avoid straight bets and stick with safer bets like corners or even/odd bets.

4. Stick to Even/Odd Bets

Even/odd bets are also a good way to reduce the risk of losing your money to an endwalker. These bets are simple and typically offer decent odds, so they’re a good choice if you want to play it safe.

5. Choose Your Numbers Wisely

Not all numbers are created equal when it comes to playing against an endwalker in an expert roulette game. Some numbers have better odds than others, so it’s important to choose wisely when placing your bets. You can find lists of the best and worst numbers online or in books about roulette strategy.

  6) Use Outside Bets Whenever Possible 

When playing against an endwalker, it’s always a good idea to use outside bets as much as possible. These bets offer better odds than inside bets and are less likely to lose you money if the endwalker wins.   7) Avoid Single Number Bets 

Single number bets may seem like a good way to win big money, but they actually offer very poor odds and should be avoided if possible when playing against an endwalker.   8) Play Slowly and Thoughtfully 

When playing against an endwalker, it’s important not to rush into making decisions. Take your time and think carefully about each bet before placing it – this will help improve your chances of winning money over time.. 9) Know When to Quit

Sometimes it’s best just to walk away from a game with an endwalker – especially if you start losing money fast. Quitting while you’re ahead is always a wise decision, so don’t be afraid to walk away if things start going bad.. 10) Practice!
