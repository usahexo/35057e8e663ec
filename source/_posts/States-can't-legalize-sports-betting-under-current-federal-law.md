#  States can't legalize sports betting under current federal law

States can't legalize sports betting under current federal law, a top Department of Justice official said on Tuesday.

"The professional and amateur sports protection act prohibits states from authorizing sports gambling," Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said during a House Judiciary Committee hearing. "That's been the law for over 25 years."

Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin asked Rosenstein whether he believes the law is unconstitutional considering a recent Supreme Court decision allowed for legalized gambling on individual sporting events in other contexts.

Rosenstein declined to give an opinion on the constitutionality of the law, but said the Department of Justice is "reviewing it."

The law, also known as PASPA, was passed in 1992 and prohibits state-sponsored sports betting with some exceptions. In May, the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on state-authorized sports gambling, which could potentially open up the market to billions of dollars in bets.

Since then, Delaware and New Jersey have moved to legalize sports betting, but they are facing legal challenges from major professional sports leagues including the NBA, NFL and MLB.

#  Delaware court strikes down law allowing sports betting

In a major victory for the gambling industry, Delaware’s Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down a law that allows sports betting in the state, ruling that it violates the Constitution’s ban on federal regulation of sports.

The ruling is a major blow to Delaware, which has been trying to attract new businesses and jobs by allowing sports betting in its casinos. The state had argued that the law was not a regulation of sports but rather a way to raise money by taxing gambling losses.

But Chief Justice Myron T. Steele said in the unanimous decision that “the Legislature cannot do indirectly what it is constitutionally prohibited from doing directly.”

“The prohibition on governmental regulation of amateur and professional athletics is absolute,” he wrote.

The decision is also a victory for the National Football League and other professional sports leagues, which have opposed any expansion of legalized gambling, arguing that it could lead to corruption of the games.

Governor Jack Markell said in a statement that he was disappointed by the decision but would work with the Legislature to come up with other ways to raise money for the state budget.

#  New Jersey sues over federal ban on sports betting

The state of New Jersey has filed a lawsuit against the United States Government in an effort to overturn a ban on sports betting.

In 1992, Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide.

New Jersey has long argued that the ban is unconstitutional, as it unfairly prevents states from benefiting from what is an otherwise legal activity.

On Monday, Governor Chris Christie announced that the state would be taking legal action against the federal government in order to allow sports betting to take place within its borders.

"This is an issue of fairness," said Christie. "New Jersey citizens should be given the opportunity to bet on sporting events, just like people in other states."

The state's lawsuit challenges PASPA on two grounds - firstly, that it violates states' rights under the 10th Amendment of the US Constitution; secondly, that it amounts to unlawful discrimination against New Jersey, as it allows other states to proceed with sports betting while banning it in New Jersey.

Backed by the American Gaming Association (AGA), Christie's lawsuit looks likely to succeed. In 2012, a similar case brought by New Jersey was rejected by a federal court on the grounds that PASPA did not unconstitutionally burden states' rights. However, this new case cites a recent change in US law which broadens the definition of what constitutes interstate commerce.

If successful, New Jersey could see a profitable boost to its economy as a result of legalized sports betting. In 2012,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Delaware - which had previously been allowed to offer limited sports betting - generated $7 million in revenue from the activity.

#  Congress weighs in on legality of sports betting

For years, the legality of sports betting has been a topic of debate among legislators and law enforcement officials. Now, with more states looking to legalize sports betting, Congress is getting involved.

In a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, lawmakers heard testimony from experts on both sides of the issue. Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it would be a boon to the economy, while opponents say it would lead to increased crime and addiction.

So far, only a handful of states have legalized sports betting, but many others are considering it. In 2017, New Jersey became the first state to challenge the federal ban on sports betting in court. In May of this year, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey, opening the door for other states to legalize it.

Some lawmakers are concerned that legalizing sports betting could lead to corruption in college athletics. Others argue that it would be difficult to enforce any prohibition on gambling on college games.

Proponents of legalization say that it would create jobs and generate tax revenue. They also argue that it would be easier to regulate than illegal gambling operations.

Opponents of legalization point to the social ills associated with gambling addiction and increased crime rates. They also argue that gambling is a regressive tax, disproportionately affecting those who can least afford it.

Congress has not yet taken a position on the legality of sports betting, but the issue is sure to continue to be debated in the months ahead.

#  Federal ban on sports betting remains in place

A federal law that bans sports betting across the United States remains in place, despite a recent ruling by the Supreme Court that struck down a similar law in

New Jersey. Advocates of legalized sports betting say the federal ban is unconstitutional and are working to have it overturned.

The law, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), was passed in 1992 and prohibits states from legalizing sports betting. In May, the Supreme Court ruled that PASPA was unconstitutional because it violated the Tenth Amendment by preventing states from making their own decisions on gambling.

Despite this ruling, the federal ban on sports betting remains in place. This is because PASPA includes a “grandfather clause” which allows four states – Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana – to continue offering legal sports betting. New Jersey did not qualify for this exemption because it had not previously allowed sports betting.

Advocates of legalized sports betting are now working to have the federal ban overturned. A bill has been introduced in Congress that would repeal PASPA and allow states to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so. The bill has bipartisan support and is expected to pass if it comes up for a vote.

Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to state governments and would create jobs in the gaming industry. They also say that it would combat illegal gambling, which is already a major problem in the United States.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it would lead to addiction and increased crime rates. They also say that it would be harmful to the integrity of sporting events.

It remains to be seen whether the federal ban on sports betting will be overturned or not, but advocates are optimistic that it will eventually be repealed.
