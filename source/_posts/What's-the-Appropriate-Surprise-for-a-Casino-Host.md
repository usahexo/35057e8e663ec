#  What's the Appropriate Surprise for a Casino Host?

When it comes to a casino host, there are many things that could be deemed as an appropriate surprise. It could range from something as small as a basket of fresh fruit, to a weekend away at a luxurious resort. The possibilities are endless, and it really depends on the relationship that has been cultivated between the casino host and their guests.

One important thing to keep in mind is that a casino host should never feel obligated to provide any sort of gift or surprise. It should always be offered out of goodwill, and should never be seen as a requirement in order to continue receiving VIP treatment.

With that being said, if you're looking for some ideas on what might make an appropriate surprise for your casino host, here are just a few examples:

-A basket of fresh fruit

-A bottle of wine or champagne

-A gift certificate to a local restaurant or spa

-Tickets to a show or sporting event

#  Speed a Little, Lose a Lot: The Perfect Reward for Your Casino Host!

When planning your next casino visit, take into account the sheer number of luxurious rewards on offer for high rollers. However, if you are looking to make the most of your trip while spending less, there is no need to worry! All hosts at the casino are looking for ways to reward players for their loyalty and often special deals and discounts can be found for those who ask.

In some cases, all it takes is a simple conversation with the host or pit boss to get the ball rolling. Hosts are often willing to give a player a small discount on their next visit in order to keep them coming back. Even a reduction of $10 or $20 can make a difference, especially when playing at higher stakes.

In addition, many casinos offer perks such as complimentary rooms, show tickets and dinner vouchers that can be used at any time during your stay. Often, these VIP rewards can be obtained without having to play any additional games or spend any extra money. Simply by being courteous and asking the right questions, you could enjoy a number of added benefits during your next casino visit.
