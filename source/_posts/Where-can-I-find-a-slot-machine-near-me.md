If you would prefer to purchase a slot machine online, there are a number of dealers who offer a wide variety of machines. Be sure to do your research before buying, as there are some unscrupulous dealers who may try to sell you a machine that doesn't work properly.

When purchasing a slot machine, be sure to ask the dealer about any warranties or return policies that may be available. In addition, be sure to find out how difficult it is to transport the machine before making your purchase.
