#  What are the odds? Blackjack Prometey edition

In this article we are going to talk about blackjack, and more specifically the odds of winning at this casino game. We will see what are the chances of getting a blackjack, as well as some other interesting facts about this popular casino game. So, if you are interested in finding out more about blackjack, keep reading!

The first thing that we are going to look at is the odds of getting a blackjack. As you may know, a blackjack is a hand that consists of an ace and a ten, or a face card. This hand is worth 21 points, and it is the highest-scoring hand in the game. So what are the odds of getting one?

Well, the odds of getting a blackjack depend on the number of decks that are being used in the game. If there are eight decks in use, then the odds of getting a blackjack are 1 in 32. If there are six decks in use, then the odds of getting a blackjack are 1 in 47. And if there are only one or two decks in use, then the odds of getting a blackjack are 1 in 16 or 1 in 8 respectively.

So as you can see, the odds of getting a blackjack vary depending on how many decks are being used. But what else affects the odds? Well, another factor that has an impact is whether you are playing against the dealer or not.

If you are playing against the dealer (which is known as playing ‘against the house’), then your chances of winning decrease slightly. This is because the dealer has an advantage over players, as they have access to more cards than players do. In fact, the dealers’ advantage ranges from around 0.5% to 2%, depending on the rules of the particular game being played.

However, if you are playing against other players (known as playing ‘against each other’), then your chances of winning increase slightly. This is because each player starts with an equal number of cards, so players have an equal chance of winning hands.

So those are some things to consider when deciding whether to play against the dealer or against other players. But what else affects your chances of winning at blackjack? Well, one thing that has an impact is your starting hand value.

If you have a low starting hand value (eg 2 or 3), then your chances of winning decrease significantly. This is because it is much harder to get close to 21 points with low cards than it is with high cards. In contrast, if you have a high starting hand value (eg 9 or 10), then your chances of winning increase significantly. This is because it is much easier to get close to 21 points with high cards than it is with low cards.

So those are some things to keep in mind when playing blackjack – your starting hand value and whether you are playing against other players or against dealers. But what about strategy? Can following certain strategies help improve your chances of winning?

Yes, following certain strategies can definitely help improve your chances of winning at blackjack! In fact, there are many different strategies that can be used – each one suited for different types of players and different situations. However, some basic tips that can help include: keeping track of which cards have been played; not splitting pairs; and doubling down on 11 points only.

So those are some things to keep in mind when playing blackjack – whether you want to play against dealers or other players, and what type of strategy you want to use. But before we finish up this article, let’s take a quick look at how blackjack compares to some other popular casino games…
